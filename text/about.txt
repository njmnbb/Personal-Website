<p class = "header">About Me</p>
<p class = "body">My name is Nick Martini, I am a 21 year old Information Technology major, and I love making websites.<br><br>When I began my journey as an IT student, I had no idea what I wanted to do once I had graduated; all I knew is that I loved working with computers. After a few computer science classes I stumbled upon a web design course and instantly fell in love with the concept. Compared to other programming languages I have used in the past, I much prefer using languages like HTML, Javascript, and PHP over languages like C. After starting this class I began to teach myself a few things that my professor did not cover such as web scraping and how to dynamically load web pages. <br><br>Although I have only been interested in web site design for a short time, my passion is at an all-time high and I would love to be a part of your workforce.</p>

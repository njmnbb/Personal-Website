<p class = "header">Projects</p>
<p class = "body">Although I have only been learning about the intricacies of web design for a short amount of time, I have completed a few projects that show some of the skills I have learned throughout my studies. Below is a list of my more in-depth projects. A link is included to view each website.<br><br>
<ul>
	<li class = "listHeader"><a href = "https://babbage.cs.missouri.edu/~njmnbb/amiibo/index">Amiibo Tracker</a></li>
	<li class = "listBody">I created this website as a means to track stock levels of amiibo figurines (interactive figurines created by Nintendo) on various websites. This site uses a variety of technologies such as AJAX calls, PHP calls to a server to get user information and information for each figure using JSON files, and web scraping to acquire stock levels for each figurine. It is definitely a work in progress, but I hope to have the front-end of the site in a cleaner state shortly.</li>
	<li class = "listHeader"><a href = "https://babbage.cs.missouri.edu/~cs3380s15grp14/project/src/index.php">IMDb Top 250</a></li>
	<li class = "listBody">This website was created as a group project for a database management class I took in a previous semester. The purpose of the site was to create a fun and easy way to view IMDb’s top 250 movies. By using the D3 JavaScript library, we were able to take data from IMDb and make it viewable in an easy to understand table. If you are logged into the site, you have the ability to rate and review movies and see others’ reviews and ratings as well. A PSQL database was used to store user data and information from IMDb, and the information was called using queries created with PHP.</li>
